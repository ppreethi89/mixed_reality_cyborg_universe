Diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) in 2017 – the same condition that afflicted Professor Stephen Hawking – Peter refused to accept his fate and embarked on a quest to become a fully-fledged cyborg. The robotics expert, based in Torquay, Devon, has already re-plumbed his stomach to avoid needing a carer to eat and go to the bathroom, and has even ditched his voice box for a digital one. He eventually hopes to walk using an exoskeleton and use an animated avatar to speak and act out his facial expressions on a computer screen.", "Dr Peter Scott-Morgan, 622, wants to enhance his deteriorating body with a high-tech exoskeleton and a mind-reading computer.
